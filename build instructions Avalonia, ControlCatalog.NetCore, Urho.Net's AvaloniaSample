Steps to build Avalonia sources from scratch, and get ControlCatalog.NetCore sample and Urho.Net's AvaloniaSample to work.

1. Deleted all bin and obj, made sure no references to Avalonia nugets, except their "Angle" nuget.

2. CSC : error CS0006: Metadata file 'C:\gh\Avalonia\src\Avalonia.DesktopRuntime\bin\Debug\net461\Avalonia.DesktopRuntime.dll' could not be found
FIX: Manually Build  Avalonia.DesktopRuntime project.
